# Introduction
Privileged Access Workstation ([PAW](https://aka.ms/paw)) management is a cumbersome task. So, this application seeks to simplify that by automating processes to reduce human error.   
This application is meant to manage end to end management of PAWs, from lifecycle management (on-board/decommission) to SILO management.

This application is meant to operate with a managed identity but supports multiple authentication methods to access the Microsoft Graph API.   
The Graph API is used to manage the various aspects of the tenant, from the Conditional Access to the Device Configurations in Endpoint Manager.
